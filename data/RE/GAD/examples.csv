4863,Our results support the hypothesis that @GENE$ genotype affects etiology and outcome of a variety of childhood @DISEASE$.,0
2249,genomic variations of @GENE$ are not likely to be substantially involved in the etiology of @DISEASE$.,1
3750,"These data indicate that TGF-beta 1 and @GENE$ genes are not loci influencing @DISEASE$ susceptibility, either RR/SPMS or PPMS, in this population.",0
4555,"Our results through Meta-analysis did not support the association between @GENE$ null genotype and @DISEASE$, but the smokers carring the GSTM1 null genotype might be associated with the increased risk of esophageal cancer.",1
704,Our data suggest that functional variants within the @GENE$ gene predispose to @DISEASE$ in Caucasian females.,0
834,"Thus, our results show that the -250G/A polymorphism in the @GENE$ gene is associated with significant variations in HDL-C levels and @DISEASE$ risk in males.",1
4284,The results of this study indicate that the missense @DISEASE$ in plasma @GENE$ is associated with development of atherosclerosis in the elderly.,0
1848,Our data suggest that the -344C allele of @GENE$ gene polymorphism is associated with the genetic predisposition to develop @DISEASE$.,1
425,the CPSI T1405N genotype appears to be an important new factor in predicting susceptibility to increased @GENE$ following surgical repair of congenital @DISEASE$ in children.,0
3561,The @GENE$-260C>T gene polymorphism was not associated with an increased risk of sub-clinical @DISEASE$ in a community population.,1
2143,The hybridization @GENE$ genotype at the site of 2257 in EXON2 of insulin-receptor gene might have a candidate gene to serve as a protective factor for @DISEASE$.,0
3336,"The strong association of specific haplotypes with some predominant @GENE$ mutations underlying PCG and the observed geographical clustering, probably due to @DISEASE$ effects, may be useful for predictive testing.",0
1107,These findings provide strong evidence of which IFN-gamma CA repeat and @GENE$ GT repeat polymorphisms influence the risk of @DISEASE$ for children in Taiwan.,1
1750,"The results reported in this study suggest that @GENE$ polymorphism is a genetic susceptibility factor involved in the carcinogenesis of cervical cancer, and also that the analysis of the allelic profile of populations in different geographic locations may help to understand the incidence of @DISEASE$ worldwide.",1
3047,"Polymorphisms of the tPA or @GENE$ genes probably do not significantly influence the risk of anerial @DISEASE$ thrombosis, or pregnancy morbidity in patients with aPL.",0
187,The data indicate that genetic variants within @GENE$ contribute significantly to IgE regulation and manifestation of @DISEASE$ diseases.,0
2402,"Our data suggest that the @GENE$ 5' non-coding region polymorphism modulates NER capacity and is associated with decreased @DISEASE$ risk, especially in the presence of exposure to tobacco carcinogens.",1
1251,we report significant association of variants of @GENE$ with @DISEASE$ and ischemic stroke subtypes among whites.,1
2884,It is not likely that @GENE$ mutations are responsible for as much as 25% of @DISEASE$.,0
3939,the mutations within the @GENE$ domain of EGFR were found to specifically occur in @DISEASE$ patients with a low exposure of tobacco smoking.,0
